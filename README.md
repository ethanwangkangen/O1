Motivation:

As long-time gamers, we are tired of games being seen as “useless” and “ a waste of time”. As such, we hope to create a game that encourages both social interaction and friendly competition. Inspired by popular AR mobile game Pokemon Go and its rivals (eg. Palworld), we intend to incorporate real-time, location-based systems (similar to those used in games like Pokemon Go and Ingress) for deeper immersion. Coupled with diverse environments, each teeming with unique creatures and new challenges to overcome, we want to create a captivating pet battling mobile game that will encourage people to leave the comforts of their homes to encounter and capture new and unique creatures.

Aim:

Darwin’s Duel is a multiplayer pet battling mobile game with 2D pixel art style. 

With a branching evolutionary system and unique skills that allows players to tailor the growth of their pets to suit their battle strategies, we hope to create a game that pushes the strategic skills of the players to their limits. 	

	In Darwin’s Duel, every monster you encounter and capture can be trained and evolved through a branching evolutionary system, allowing you to tailor their growth to suit your battle strategies. Explore diverse environments, each teeming with unique creatures and challenges, making every gameplay session a new adventure.

The heart of Darwin’s Duel lies in its competitive battles. Players can engage in real-time duels with others. Victories yield rewards and prestige, helping you climb the global leaderboards and cement your status as the ultimate Duelist.

User Stories:

As a personal fan of Pokemon since young, I want a game that incorporates similar elements of virtual pet fighting; against both non-playable (i.e. pre-programmed) entities and other players.

As a student, who wants to meet new people and make new friends, I want to be able to enter “combat” with other players (students from NUS) and interact with them. I also want to be incentivised to explore the outdoors more.

Project Scope:

	In Darwin’s Duel, players travel the in-game world through location-based systems that track their real-life locations. Players can encounter, capture a wide variety of creatures while exploring diverse environments. They can then train and evolve these pets by engaging in battles with others while obtaining new skills and items that will enhance their battle capabilities. By engaging in real-time duels with other players, they can climb leaderboards and gain both prestige and unique rewards.
